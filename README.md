### Description ###
Linky.io is a native Android application which allows users to exchange contact information, social media and more
via QR codes. On average, a GEN Z-er has 8.4 social media accounts, according to Global Web Index. Exchanging 
contact information between two people who have 8 accounts is a tedious process, but with Linky.io, users can scan 
each otherâ€™s QR codes and share the information all at once.
